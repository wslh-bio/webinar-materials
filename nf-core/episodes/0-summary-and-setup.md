# Summary and Setup

## nf-core for Standardized and Reproducible Nextflow Pipeline Development 

###### an introduction to the nf-core framework for bioinformaticians with Nextflow experience

The goal of this lesson is to teach bioinformaticians with a basic understanding of Nextflow the fundamentals of the nf-core framework for pipeline development. Nextflow is a workflow management language used to develop bioinformatics pipelines, and the nf-core framework is a system for creating standardized, reproducible, and portable Nextflow pipelines. Students will learn the principles and benefits of using the nf-core framework, how to use nf-core pipelines, and how to create a simple, custom nf-core pipeline.

**Note**: This lesson will mostly focus on the fundamentals of the nf-core framework and will only give a brief review of Nextflow fundamentals. Some Nextflow experience is highly recommended.

This lesson assumes you have Nextflow, nf-core, and Docker installed on your computer:
- Download and install the latest version of Nextflow [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html).  
- Download and install nf-core [here](https://nf-co.re/docs/nf-core-tools/installation).  
- Download and install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).  
- nf-core also has a guide for installing its dependencies [here](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/installation).
